  author      = "Gavryushkin, Alex and Whidden, Chris and Matsen, 4th,
                 Frederick A",
  abstract    = "A time-tree is a rooted phylogenetic tree such that all
                 internal nodes are equipped with absolute divergence dates and
                 all leaf nodes are equipped with sampling dates. Such
                 time-trees have become a central object of study in
                 phylogenetics but little is known about the parameter space of
                 such objects. Here we introduce and study a hierarchy of
                 discrete approximations of the space of time-trees from the
                 graph-theoretic and algorithmic point of view. One of the
                 basic and widely used phylogenetic graphs, the [Formula: see
                 text] graph, is the roughest approximation and bottom level of
                 our hierarchy. More refined approximations discretize the
                 relative timing of evolutionary divergence and sampling dates.
                 We study basic graph-theoretic questions for these graphs,
                 including the size of neighborhoods, diameter upper and lower
                 bounds, and the problem of finding shortest paths. We settle
                 many of these questions by extending the concept of graph
                 grammars introduced by Sleator, Tarjan, and Thurston to our
                 graphs. Although time values greatly increase the number of
                 possible trees, we show that 1-neighborhood sizes remain
                 linear, allowing for efficient local exploration and
                 construction of these graphs. We also obtain upper bounds on
                 the r-neighborhood sizes of these graphs, including a smaller
                 bound than was previously known for [Formula: see text]. Our
                 results open up a number of possible directions for
                 theoretical investigation of graph-theoretic and algorithmic
                 properties of the time-tree graphs. We discuss the directions
                 that are most valuable for phylogenetic applications and give
                 a list of prominent open problems for those applications. In
                 particular, we conjecture that the split theorem applies to
                 shortest paths in time-tree graphs, a property not shared in
                 the general [Formula: see text] case.",

                 between evolutionary trees. The trees we consider are free
                 3-trees having n leaves labeled 0,..., n − 1 (representing
                 species), and n − 2 internal nodes of degree 3. The distance
                 between two trees is the minimum number of nearest neighbour
                 interchange (NNI) operations required to transform one into
                 the other. First, we improve an upper bound on the
                 nni-distance between two arbitrary n-node trees from 4n log n
                 [2] to n log n. Second, we present a counterexample disproving
                 several theorems in [13]. Roughly speaking, finding an equal
                 partition between two trees doesn't imply decomposability of
                 the distance finding problem. Third, we present a
                 polynomial-time approximation algorithm that, given two trees,
                 finds a transformation between them of length O(log n) times
                 their distance. We also present some results of computations
