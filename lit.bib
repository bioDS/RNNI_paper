abstract="We present some new results on a well known distance measure between evolutionary trees.
The trees we consider are free 3-trees having n leaves labeled 0,..., n − 1 (representing species), and n − 2 internal nodes of degree 3
The distance between two trees is the minimum number of nearest neighbour interchange (NNI) operations required to transform one into the other
First, we improve an upper bound on the nni-distance between two arbitrary n-node trees from 4n log n [2] to n log n
Second, we present a counterexample disproving several theorems in [13]
Roughly speaking, finding an equal partition between two trees doesn't imply decomposability of the distance finding problem
Third, we present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that, given two trees, finds a transformation between them of length O(log n) times their distance
We also present some results of computations we performed on small size trees.",

abstract="The graph-theoretic operation of rooted subtree prune and regraft is increasingly being used as a tool for understanding and modelling reticulation events in evolutionary biology. In this paper, we show that computing the rooted subtree prune and regraft distance between two rooted binary phylogenetic trees on the same label set is NP-hard. This resolves a longstanding open problem. Furthermore, we show that this distance is fixed parameter tractable when parameterised by the distance between the two trees.",
