                 rearrangement operations such as subtree-prune-regraft (SPR)
                 to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) across tree
                 topologies. These methods are known to mix quickly when
                 sampling from the simple uniform distribution of trees but may
                 become stuck in the local optima of multi-modal posterior
                 distributions for real data induced by non-uniform
                 likelihoods. The structure of the graph induced by tree
                 rearrangement operations is an important determinant of the
                 mixing properties of MCMC, motivating study of the underlying
                 rSPR graph in greater detail. In this paper, we investigate
                 the rSPR graph in a new way: by calculating Ricci-Ollivier
                 curvature with respect to uniform and Metropolis-Hastings
                 random walks. We confirm using simulation that mean access
                 time distributions depend on distance, degree, and curvature,
                 showing the relevance of these curvature results to stochastic
                 tree search. These calculations require fast new algorithms
                 for constructing and sampling these graphs, reducing the time
                 required to compute an rSPR graph from O(m2n)-time to O(mn3),
                 where m is the (often large) number of trees in the graph and
                 n their number of leaves, and reducing the time required to
                 select an SPR neighbor of a tree uniformly at random to O(n)
                 time. We then develop a closed form solution to characterize
                 how the number of SPR neighbors of a tree changes after an SPR
                 operation is applied to that tree. This gives bounds on the
                 curvature, as well as a flatness-in-the-limit theorem
                 indicating that paths of small topology changes are easy to
                 traverse. However, we find that large topology changes (i.e.
                 moving a large subtree) gives pairs of trees with negative
                 curvature. Although these pairs of trees with negative
                 curvature do not impede mixing in this simple well-connected
                 space, they may manifest as bottlenecks in the much smaller
                 credible sets induced by phylogenetic posteriors with a
                 likelihood function. This work extends our knowledge of the
                 rSPR graph, in particular properties that are relevant for
                 investigation of sampling the rSPR graph.",

  abstract    = "A time-tree is a rooted phylogenetic tree such that all
                 internal nodes are equipped with absolute divergence dates and
                 all leaf nodes are equipped with sampling dates. Such
                 time-trees have become a central object of study in
                 phylogenetics but little is known about the parameter space of
                 such objects. Here we introduce and study a hierarchy of
                 discrete approximations of the space of time-trees from the
                 graph-theoretic and algorithmic point of view. One of the
                 basic and widely used phylogenetic graphs, the [Formula: see
                 text] graph, is the roughest approximation and bottom level of
                 our hierarchy. More refined approximations discretize the
                 relative timing of evolutionary divergence and sampling dates.
                 We study basic graph-theoretic questions for these graphs,
                 including the size of neighborhoods, diameter upper and lower
                 bounds, and the problem of finding shortest paths. We settle
                 many of these questions by extending the concept of graph
                 grammars introduced by Sleator, Tarjan, and Thurston to our
                 graphs. Although time values greatly increase the number of
                 possible trees, we show that 1-neighborhood sizes remain
                 linear, allowing for efficient local exploration and
                 construction of these graphs. We also obtain upper bounds on
                 the r-neighborhood sizes of these graphs, including a smaller
                 bound than was previously known for [Formula: see text]. Our
                 results open up a number of possible directions for
                 theoretical investigation of graph-theoretic and algorithmic
                 properties of the time-tree graphs. We discuss the directions
                 that are most valuable for phylogenetic applications and give
                 a list of prominent open problems for those applications. In
                 particular, we conjecture that the split theorem applies to
                 shortest paths in time-tree graphs, a property not shared in
                 the general [Formula: see text] case.",

              sequence data is ensured by its statistical consistency. Bayesian
              inference methods produce a sample of phylogenetic trees from the
              posterior distribution given sequence data. Hence the question of
              statistical consistency of such methods is equivalent to the
              consistency of the summary of the sample. More generally,
              statistical consistency is ensured by the tree space used to
              analyse the sample. In this paper, we consider two standard
              parameterisations of phylogenetic time-trees used in evolutionary
              models: inter-coalescent interval lengths and absolute times of
              divergence events. For each of these parameterisations we
              introduce a natural metric space on ultrametric phylogenetic
              trees. We compare the introduced spaces with existing models of
              tree space and formulate several formal requirements that a
              metric space on phylogenetic trees must possess in order to be a
              satisfactory space for statistical analysis, and justify them. We
              show that only a few known constructions of the space of
              phylogenetic trees satisfy these requirements. However, our
              results suggest that these basic requirements are not enough to
              distinguish between the two metric spaces we introduce and that
              the choice between metric spaces requires additional properties
              to be considered. Particularly, that the summary tree minimising
              the square distance to the trees from the sample might be
              different for different parameterisations. This suggests that

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Relaxed molecular clock models allow divergence time
               dating and ``relaxed phylogenetic'' inference, in which a time
               tree is estimated in the face of unequal rates across lineages.
               We present a new method for relaxing the assumption of a strict
               molecular clock using Markov chain Monte Carlo to implement
               Bayesian modeling averaging over random local molecular clocks.
               The new method approaches the problem of rate variation among
               lineages by proposing a series of local molecular clocks, each
               extending over a subregion of the full phylogeny. Each branch in
               a phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a possible location for a
               change of rate from one local clock to a new one. Thus,
               including both the global molecular clock and the unconstrained
               model results, there are a total of 2(2n-2) possible rate models
               available for averaging with 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2 different rate
               categories. RESULTS: We propose an efficient method to sample
               this model space while simultaneously estimating the phylogeny.
               The new method conveniently allows a direct test of the strict
               molecular clock, in which one rate rules them all, against a
               large array of alternative local molecular clock models. We
               illustrate the method's utility on three example data sets
               involving mammal, primate and influenza evolution. Finally, we
               explore methods to visualize the complex posterior distribution
               that results from inference under such models. CONCLUSIONS: The
               examples suggest that large sequence datasets may only require a
               small number of local molecular clocks to reconcile their branch
               lengths with a time scale. All of the analyses described here

               molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite
               their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that
               both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary
               process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately,
               intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been
               described. These models open the gate to a new field of
               ``relaxed phylogenetics.'' Here we introduce a new approach to
               performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can
               be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face
               of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our
               approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness
               of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes
               and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation
               among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that
               autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these
               data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of
               clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the
               alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of
               102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate
               alignments. From these we conclude that our method is

               calibration points were used based on paleontological data: one
               at 20-25 MYA for the hominoid/cercopithecoid divergence, one at
               53-57 MYA for the cetacean/artiodactyl divergence, and the third
               at 110-130 MYA for the metatherian/eutherian divergence. Both
               the nucleotide and the amino acid sequences were analyzed,
               producing conflicting results. The global molecular clock was
               clearly violated for both the nucleotide and the amino acid
               data. Models of local clocks were implemented using maximum
               likelihood, allowing different evolutionary rates for some
               lineages while assuming rate constancy in others. Surprisingly,
               the highly divergent third codon positions appeared to contain
               phylogenetic information and produced more sensible estimates of
               primate divergence dates than did the amino acid sequences.
               Estimated dates varied considerably depending on the data type,
               the calibration point, and the substitution model but differed
               little among the four tree topologies used. We conclude that the
               calibration derived from the primate fossil record is too recent
               to be reliable; we also point out a number of problems in date
               estimation when the molecular clock does not hold. Despite these

              Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very

                   tree space systematically, and never return to the same
                   topology. In this paper, we present an efficient
                   parallelized method to map out the high likelihood set of
                   phylogenetic tree topologies via systematic search, which we
                   show to be a good approximation of the high posterior set of
                   tree topologies. Here `likelihood' of a topology refers to
                   the tree likelihood for the corresponding tree with
                   optimized branch lengths. We call this method `phylogenetic
                   topographer' (PT). The PT strategy is very simple: starting
                   in a number of local topology maxima (obtained by
                   hill-climbing from random starting points), explore out
                   using local topology rearrangements, only continuing through
                   topologies that are better than than some likelihood
                   threshold below the best observed topology. We show that the
                   normalized topology likelihoods are a useful proxy for the
                   Bayesian posterior probability of those topologies. By using
                   a non-blocking hash table keyed on unique representations of

                   accurate means of evaluating per-topology marginal
                   likelihoods, PT gives an alternative procedure for obtaining
