  abstract    = "A time-tree is a rooted phylogenetic tree such that all
                 internal nodes are equipped with absolute divergence dates and
                 all leaf nodes are equipped with sampling dates. Such
                 time-trees have become a central object of study in
                 phylogenetics but little is known about the parameter space of
                 such objects. Here we introduce and study a hierarchy of
                 discrete approximations of the space of time-trees from the
                 graph-theoretic and algorithmic point of view. One of the
                 basic and widely used phylogenetic graphs, the [Formula: see
                 text] graph, is the roughest approximation and bottom level of
                 our hierarchy. More refined approximations discretize the
                 relative timing of evolutionary divergence and sampling dates.
                 We study basic graph-theoretic questions for these graphs,
                 including the size of neighborhoods, diameter upper and lower
                 bounds, and the problem of finding shortest paths. We settle
                 many of these questions by extending the concept of graph
                 grammars introduced by Sleator, Tarjan, and Thurston to our
                 graphs. Although time values greatly increase the number of
                 possible trees, we show that 1-neighborhood sizes remain
                 linear, allowing for efficient local exploration and
                 construction of these graphs. We also obtain upper bounds on
                 the r-neighborhood sizes of these graphs, including a smaller
                 bound than was previously known for [Formula: see text]. Our
                 results open up a number of possible directions for
                 theoretical investigation of graph-theoretic and algorithmic
                 properties of the time-tree graphs. We discuss the directions
                 that are most valuable for phylogenetic applications and give
                 a list of prominent open problems for those applications. In
                 particular, we conjecture that the split theorem applies to
                 shortest paths in time-tree graphs, a property not shared in
                 the general [Formula: see text] case.",

              sequence data is ensured by its statistical consistency. Bayesian
              inference methods produce a sample of phylogenetic trees from the
              posterior distribution given sequence data. Hence the question of
              statistical consistency of such methods is equivalent to the
              consistency of the summary of the sample. More generally,
              statistical consistency is ensured by the tree space used to
              analyse the sample. In this paper, we consider two standard
              parameterisations of phylogenetic time-trees used in evolutionary
              models: inter-coalescent interval lengths and absolute times of
              divergence events. For each of these parameterisations we
              introduce a natural metric space on ultrametric phylogenetic
              trees. We compare the introduced spaces with existing models of

              satisfactory space for statistical analysis, and justify them. We
              show that only a few known constructions of the space of
              phylogenetic trees satisfy these requirements. However, our
              results suggest that these basic requirements are not enough to
              distinguish between the two metric spaces we introduce and that
              the choice between metric spaces requires additional properties

              the square distance to the trees from the sample might be
              different for different parameterisations. This suggests that

               dating and ``relaxed phylogenetic'' inference, in which a time
               tree is estimated in the face of unequal rates across lineages.
               We present a new method for relaxing the assumption of a strict
               molecular clock using Markov chain Monte Carlo to implement
               Bayesian modeling averaging over random local molecular clocks.
               The new method approaches the problem of rate variation among
               lineages by proposing a series of local molecular clocks, each
               extending over a subregion of the full phylogeny. Each branch in
               a phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a possible location for a
               change of rate from one local clock to a new one. Thus,
               including both the global molecular clock and the unconstrained
               model results, there are a total of 2(2n-2) possible rate models
               available for averaging with 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2 different rate
               categories. RESULTS: We propose an efficient method to sample
               this model space while simultaneously estimating the phylogeny.
               The new method conveniently allows a direct test of the strict
               molecular clock, in which one rate rules them all, against a
               large array of alternative local molecular clock models. We
               illustrate the method's utility on three example data sets
               involving mammal, primate and influenza evolution. Finally, we
               explore methods to visualize the complex posterior distribution
               that results from inference under such models. CONCLUSIONS: The
               examples suggest that large sequence datasets may only require a
               small number of local molecular clocks to reconcile their branch
               lengths with a time scale. All of the analyses described here

               process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately,
               intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been
               described. These models open the gate to a new field of
               ``relaxed phylogenetics.'' Here we introduce a new approach to
               performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can
               be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face
               of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our
               approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness
               of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes
               and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation
               among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that
               autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these
               data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of
               clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the
               alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of
               102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate
               alignments. From these we conclude that our method is
               phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional
               unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to
               evolution.",

               mammalian species were analyzed to estimate the speciation dates
               within primates and also between rats and mice. Three
               calibration points were used based on paleontological data: one
               at 20-25 MYA for the hominoid/cercopithecoid divergence, one at
               53-57 MYA for the cetacean/artiodactyl divergence, and the third
               at 110-130 MYA for the metatherian/eutherian divergence. Both
               the nucleotide and the amino acid sequences were analyzed,
               producing conflicting results. The global molecular clock was
               clearly violated for both the nucleotide and the amino acid
               data. Models of local clocks were implemented using maximum
               likelihood, allowing different evolutionary rates for some
               lineages while assuming rate constancy in others. Surprisingly,
               the highly divergent third codon positions appeared to contain
               phylogenetic information and produced more sensible estimates of
               primate divergence dates than did the amino acid sequences.
               Estimated dates varied considerably depending on the data type,
               the calibration point, and the substitution model but differed
               little among the four tree topologies used. We conclude that the
               calibration derived from the primate fossil record is too recent
               to be reliable; we also point out a number of problems in date
               estimation when the molecular clock does not hold. Despite these
               obstacles, we derived estimates of primate divergence dates that
               were well supported by the data and were generally consistent
               with the paleontological record. Estimation of the mouse-rat
               divergence date, however, was problematic.",
