\begin{conjecture}
	The set of caterpillar trees is convex in $\rnni$ space.
\end{conjecture}

This conjecture is computationally proven for up to $8$ taxa (maximum $\rnni$ graph we can compute).
For a more restricted subset of trees in $\rnni$, namely caterpillar trees that have one cherry leaf in common, one can show convexity.

\begin{lemma}
	Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be two caterpillar trees that both have a leaf labelled by $a$ as part of their cherry.
	There is a shortest paths from $T_1$ to $T_2$ that is a caterpillar path.
	\label{lemma:caterpillar_subset_convex}
\end{lemma}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{label_internal_nodes}
	\caption{The labelling of the caterpillar tree as introduced in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:caterpillar_subset_convex} is unique due to its definition.
	}
	\label{label_internal_nodes}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
	Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be two caterpillar trees, both having a leaf labelled by $a$ as part of their cherry.
	Let $p$ be a shortest path from $T_1$ to $T_2$.
	We introduce a labelling of internal nodes of all trees on $p$ by first defining it for $T_1$ and $T_2$ and then explaining how the labelling is changed by $\rnni$ moves.

	In $T_1$ and $T_2$ the internal node of the cherry is labelled by the label of its child that is not $a$.
	All other internal nodes shall have the same label as their leaf children.
	From now on we will identify the leaf labelled by $x$ with $x$ and the internal node labelled by $x$ will be called $int_x$.
	An example for a caterpillar tree with internal leaf labels is depicted in Figure~\ref{label_internal_nodes}.
	In the following, changes of the internal labelling following $\rnni$ moves are defined:

	\textbf{Rank swaps:}
	Within rank swaps the labels of internal nodes do not change.
	For an example consider Figure~\ref{fig:rank_swap_internal_label}.

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{rank_swap_internal_label}
		\caption{The labelling of the internal nodes that swap ranks (red) do not change within the rank swap.
		}
		\label{fig:rank_swap_internal_label}
	\end{figure}

	\textbf{NNI move:}
	Let there be an $\nni$ move on an edge $(int_x, int_y)$ where $rank(int_x) < rank(int_y)$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:nni_moves}.

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{nni_moves_internal_label}
		\caption{Two possible $\nni$ moves on edge $(int_x, int_y)$ where $x \in A, y \in B$.
		}
		\label{fig:nni_moves}
	\end{figure}

	The nodes incident to the edge after the $\nni$ move are labelled by $int_x$ and $int_y$ as well.
	By default, the node that has lower rank than the other one is labelled by $int_x$, the other one by $int_y$.
	But if $int_x$ is no ancestor of $x$ or $int_y$ is no ancestor of $y$, we swap the labels of the two new nodes, such that $rank(int_x) > rank(int_y)$.
	An example of an $\nni$ move and the new labelling is provided in Figure~\ref{fig:nni_example_internal_label}.

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{nni_example_internal_label}
		\caption{The first labelling after the $\nni$ move preserves the ranks of $int_4$ and $int_6$.
		But then $int_6$ is not an ancestor of $6$ any more.
		Therefore, $int_4$ and $int_6$ have to change their labels.
		}
		\label{fig:nni_example_internal_label}
	\end{figure}

	We proceed to show that $int_x$ and $int_y$ are ancestors of $x$ and $y$ after an $\nni$ move as described above, respectively.
	Let $A$ and $B$ be the subtrees that are children of $int_x$ and $C$ the subtree that is child of $int_y$ and does not contain $A$ and $B$, as depicted on the left of .
	Without loss of generality we can assume that $x \in A$, because $int_x$ is an ancestor of $x$ before the $\nni$ move.
	If otherwise $x\in B$, we just need to exchange $A$ and $B$ in the following argumentation.

	If $A$ is a child of the lower of both new nodes after the $\nni$ move, as in the upper tree on the right of Figure~\ref{fig:nni_example_internal_label}, we can keep the rank order of $int_x$ and $int_y$.
	So we assign $int_x$ to the lower node that is parent of $A$ and $C$ and $int_y$ to the upper node that is parent of $B$.
	Because $x \in A$ and $y \in A \cup B \cup C$, $int_x$ and $int_y$ are ancestors of $x$ and $y$, respectively.

	Let us now consider the $\nni$ move that results in a tree where $B$ and $C$ are the children of the lower of the two new nodes and $A$ is children of the upper new node.
	Because $x \in A$, $int_x$ needs to be assigned to the upper new node.
	It remains to prove that $y \in B \cup C$ to make sure that $int_y$ is an ancestor of $y$ after the $\nni$ move.

	In the following we consider the tree after the $\nni$ move.
	We know that $y \in A \cup B \cup C$, because $int_y$ is an ancestor of $y$ before the $\nni$ move.
	Therefore, it is sufficient to prove $y \notin A$.
	Let us consider the subtree $A$ and the labels of its internal nodes.
	Let $|A| = k$ be the number of leaves in $A$.
	There are $k-1$ internal nodes in $A$ that need to be labelled by these leaves.
	The parent of the root of $A$ is $int_x$, as it is labelled by $x$.
	Because $x \in A$, there are $k - 1$ leaves remaining in $A$ that must label some internal nodes.
	As the $k-1$ internal nodes of $A$ must be labelled by leafs that are descendants of these nodes, these labels need to be the $k-1$ leafs of $A$.
	Therefore, it holds:
	$int_z \in A \iff z \in A$.
	And as we know that $int_y \notin A$, $y$ can not be a leaf of $A$.
	Therefore, it is $y \in B \cup C$ and thus, $int_y$ is an ancestor of $y$ after the $\nni$ move.

	Concluding we see that our labelling is well defined.
	Another thing we should point out is that this labelling method leads to the labelling of $T_2$ as it is defined for caterpillar trees.
	This follows directly from the fact that $int_z$ is an ancestor of the leaf labelled by $z$.
	If one considers the internal node in $T_2$ with lowest rank, it can only have the label of the leaf in the cherry that is not labelled by $a$, because $int_z$ is an ancestor of $z$ for all leaf labels $z$.
	Now we can stepwise consider all internal nodes with rank one higher than the previously considered node and receive the same result.
	Hence, our way to change the labels of internal nodes on $p$ is consistent and ends in the correct labelling of $T_2$.

	Now we want to use this labelling to prove that there is always a caterpillar path that is at least as short as the given shortest path $p$.
	Therefore, we use the following observation:
	Within each $\rnni$ move the ranks of at most two internal nodes change by at most one each.
	This is true for both, rank swaps and $\nni$ moves.
	Within a rank swap two nodes simply exchange their ranks.
	And within an $\nni$ move two new nodes arise and are labelled by the former two nodes that bounded the edge on that the $\nni$ move is performed.
	But still, the ranks of these two nodes $int_x$ and $int_y$ both change by $1$.

	On a caterpillar path the only possible moves are $\nni$ moves.
	However, each of these $\nni$ move change the ranks of two internal nodes by at most one each.
	Therefore, we can construct a caterpillar path $r$ out of $p$:
	every time two internla nodes $int_x$ and $int_y$ exchange ranks, they do so on the caterpillar path $r$ as well.
	Since there are moves on $p$ that do not change the ranks of internal nodes, this caterpillar path has length $|r| \leq |p|$.
	Hence, there is always a shortest path between $T_1$ and $T_2$ that is a caterpillar path.
\end{proof}

\section{Split Theorem}

When analysing the complexity of the $\rnni$ space, the comparison to $\nni$ is an important step.
The proof of NP-completeness of $\nni$ in~\cite{jiang2000} is based on the fact that following theorem holds in $\nni$.

\begin{theorem}
	There are trees $T_1,T_2$ in $\nni$ sharing a partition which is not shared by any intermediate tree on a shortest path from $T_1$ to $T_2$.
	\label{thm:split_nni}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	See~\cite{Li1996}.
\end{proof}

The proof presented in~\cite{Li1996} for Theorem~\ref{thm:split_nni} does not work for $\rnni$. \todo{because?}
Therefore, the following conjecture was raised~\cite{Gavryushkin2017}.

\begin{conjecture}[Split Theorem]
	For the $\rnni$ graph the following statement holds:
	If a partition of leaves given by an edge is present in two trees $T$ and $R$ then the partition is presented in every tree on every shortest path between $T$ and $R$.
	\label{split_theorem}
\end{conjecture}

However, we found a counterexample to this conjecture:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{split_theorem_counterexample}
	\caption{The split $123|45$ is present in $T_1$ and $T_2$, but in none of the trees on this shortest caterpillar path between them.}
	\label{split_theorem_counterexample}
\end{figure}

Since this counterexample clearly shows that the version of the Split Theorem stated in~\cite{Gavryushkin2017} does not hold, we will now claim an alternative to this conjecture.
The alternative formulation is based on the observation that there is a shortest path preserving all splits between the trees of the counterexample of the Split Theorem.
This path is shown in Figure~\ref{split_theorem_no_counterexample}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{split_theorem_no_counterexample}
	\caption{The Split $123|45$ is present in $T_1$ and $T_2$ and in every tree on this shortest path between them.}
	\label{split_theorem_no_counterexample}
\end{figure}


\begin{conjecture}[Weak Split Theorem]
	For $\rnni$ graph the following statement holds:
	if a partition of leaves given by an edge is present in two trees $T$ and $R$ then there exists a shortest path between $T$ and $R$ where this partition is present in every tree on this path.
	\label{split_theorem_weak}
\end{conjecture}


% The weak Split Theorem (in the version as in Lena's thesis) is computationally proven to hold for trees with up to $6$ taxa ($\sim 38$ min running time on laptop).
% We might want to consider the Cluster Theorem as well.
% The weak split theorem is stronger than the cluster theorem, since it also makes a statement about some trees that do not share a cluster

%A further and even weaker alternative formulation of the Split Theorem is the \emph{Cluster Theorem}, which considers clusters instead of splits.
%One can see that the trees of our counterexample~\ref{split_theorem_counterexample} do not fulfil the assumptions of the cluster theorem.
%
%\begin{conjecture}[Cluster Theorem]
%	For the $\rnni$ graph the following statement holds:
%	if two trees $T$ and $R$ contain the same cluster $C$, then $C$ is present as cluster in every tree on every shortest path between $T$ and $R$.
%	\label{cluster_theorem}
%\end{conjecture}


\section{Approximating Distances}

Following algorithm computes paths between two trees in $\rnni$:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{FIND\_PATH($T_1,T_2$)}
\label{alg:find_path}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\STATE $T := T_1$
	\STATE $p := (T_1)$
	\FOR {$r = 1, \dots, n-2$}
		\STATE Let $S$ be the cluster associated with the node $v$ in $T_2$ with $rank(v) = r$
		\WHILE {$rank(MRCA_T(S))>r$}
			\STATE Update $T$: Decrease $rank(MRCA_T(S))$ by an $\rnni$ move \label{alg:line:move_set_down}
			\STATE $p = p+T$
		\ENDWHILE
	\ENDFOR
	\RETURN p
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

One can easily prove that there is always exactly one possible $\rnni$ move that decreases the rank of $MRCA_T(S)$ as in line~\ref{alg:line:move_set_down} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:find_path}.

The proof of Theorem 7 in \cite{Gavryushkin2017} gives an algorithm to compute paths between trees in $\rnni$.

% Compare the two algorithms by sampling trees and check which algorithm gives shorter paths.

% Also mention the exact algortihm for computing the whole RNNI space for up to 7 (?) taxa and check that Algorithm find_path gives correct distances there.
%Maybe it's worth trying the other algorithm in these trees as well.

Algorithm~\ref{alg:find_path} provides an upper bound for the diameter of $\rnniu$ space.
It improves the bound $n^2 - 3n - \frac{5}{8}$ given in \cite{Gavryushkin2017}.

\begin{theorem}
	For $n \geq 3$, $\Delta(\rnniu) \leq \frac{1}{2}n^2-\frac{3}{2}n+1$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	This result directly follows from Algorithm~\ref{alg:find_path}.
	In the worst case each $r = 1, \dots, n-2$ requires $n-1-r$ $\rnni$ moves for moving the corresponding $MRCA$ down.
	Hence, there is for each pair of trees a path of length less or equal to $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n-2} i = \frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}n^2-\frac{3}{2}n+1$.
\end{proof}

% Is this boundary tight? Idea: there are always caterpillar trees that have this distance (we can already check this computationally, if we were to prove the caterpillar convexity, this follows directly)

\begin{lemma}
	There are two caterpillar trees with distance $\frac{1}{2}n^2-\frac{3}{2}n+1$ if the set of caterpillar trees is convex.
	\label{lemma:caterpillar_diameter_convex}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	If the set of caterpillar trees is convex, Bubble Sort proves that there is a caterpillar path between the caterpillar trees
	$(( \dots (1,2)3)\dots)n)$ and $(( \dots (n,n-1)n-2)\dots)1)$ with length $\frac{1}{2}n^2-\frac{3}{2}n+1$. 
	\todo{Explain how to use Bubble Sort}
\end{proof}

\begin{conjecture}
	There are two caterpillar trees in $\rnniu$ with distance $\frac{1}{2}n^2-\frac{3}{2}n+1$.
	\label{conj:caterpillar_diameter}
\end{conjecture}

% This can be computationally proven for up to $8$ taxa.

\begin{proof}
	Consider trees $(( \dots (n,1)2)\dots)n-1)$ and $(( \dots (n,n-1)n-2)\dots)1)$ and apply Lemma~\ref{lemma:caterpillar_subset_convex} and use Bubble Sort.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	If Conjecture~\ref{conj:caterpillar_diameter} holds, it is $\Delta(\rnniu) = \frac{1}{2}n^2-\frac{3}{2}n+1$.
\end{corollary}

\section{Partition lattice}

% Define Partition Lattice $\Pi_n$ and max chains in that lattice!

\begin{theorem}
	The $\rnni$ space on $n$ taxa is isomorphic to the space of maximum chains of the partition lattice $\Pi_n$ where two maximum chains are connected by an edge if, and only if, they differ by exactly one partition.
\end{theorem}
